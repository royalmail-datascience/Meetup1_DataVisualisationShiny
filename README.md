# Royal Mail Data Science 


Royal Mail is launching a series of free events led by our award-winning Data Science team with the aim of getting more people to consider Data Science as a career. 

Data Science has one of the worst female to male ratios of all STEM-related careers as well as falling well behind in attracting minority groups into the profession. Diversity should be essential to any modern business as it is shown to widen perspectives, drive innovation and improve employee performance.

Therefore, we, the Royal Mail Data Science team are on a mission to change this and help increase the number of under-represented groups in Data Science!

The aim of this series of events (Workshops, Meetups, Hackathons, etc) is to actively encourage anyone from an underrepresented group to get involved, even if you have little or no experience in Data Science. We want to provide a friendly and safe learning environment and Data Science experts from Royal Mail on hand to support you along the way.
